### Original assignment description

The code that was turned in can be found under the [1.0 tag](https://github.com/eybbus/hackus_news/tree/1.0) .

> Ladies & Gents! After some speculation and debate we have decided that the last assignment of this course should be completely open. You should aim to do your absolute best and use the knowledge you have acquired throughout the semester and apply it accordingly. Have in mind the assignment is for up to 4 people so you should be able to distribute the workload and produce something up to standards.
> 
> Conditions
> * Any data used should not be hard coded but fetched from an endpoint
> * If your app requires you to share data between components, use a state management library such as redux where applicable
> * App should be as close to a release version as possible. Please keep this in mind when scoping your project.
> 
> Things to consider
> * If you are not sure about the scope of your idea, talk it over with us.
> * If no person in your group has an idea that you want to work on, talk it over with us.
> * If you have more than one brilliant idea, consider sharing it with the rest of the class for those who are short on ideas.
> Official deadline is 6th of November. However if you feel like you need more time, let us know and we will try to be as flexible as possible to accommodate your needs. All within the realms of good sensibility and practicality of course.
> 
> Good luck!

#### Grade and comments
The given grade was 8.3 out of 10.

Criteria | Ratings | Points
------------ | ------------- | -----------
Functionality | App works, even though it took me a while to figure out what the app did, since I was constantly routed out of the app and into the browser. Just a few UX perspective pointers. Could have helped to write "Hacker News" instead of "HN" in the headers (acronyms can be very misleading). The new button in the top right corner was misleading, looks like a button to add new stuff, could have done something like "Most recent" or add a sorting icon or something along those lines. | 4/4 pts
Code | Code is readable and really well organised and broken down. Just minor things I'd like you to consider. -0.2 I did encounter some warnings about missing unique key's. Would have been great to see you handle the errors in other ways than silently logging them (for example using toast or flash message). | 3.8/4 pts
Extra | Kudos for the "Read Later" feature. I wished you'd taken this a bit further though, e.g. open the articles within the app, similar to instagram & snapchat or allow me to comment on articles, favourite them or share! Or at least given it a cool styling and animation. I encourage you to keep working on this app! | 0.5/2 pts

#### Thoughts
Overall I was happy with what me and my partner turned in, given the circumstances. This was a semester where 3-4 big projects from diffirent courses clashed together. Also the project was thought to be for a group of 4.

But I would have wanted to turn in better. The comment the teacher gave for the extra functionality was exactly what I wanted to add to the project if we had more time.
The comment of uniq key, if I remember correctly, was a bug I thought I had fixed.
